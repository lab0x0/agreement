## Long public version

This version focuses on specific instructions to people at DimSumLabs,
with the goal of preventing harassment in the first place through
education. Suitable for the web site and printed material.

> DimSumLabs is dedicated to providing a harassment-free experience
> for everyone, regardless of gender, gender identity and expression,
> sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size,
> race, political affiliation or religion. We do not tolerate harassment
> of people at our events or space in any form. People violating these

> 
> Harassment includes offensive verbal comments related to gender,
> gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability,
> physical appearance, body size, race, political affiliation and
> religion. Harassment also includes sexual images in public spaces,
> deliberate intimidation, verbal or physical threats, stalking, following,
> harassing photography or recording, sustained disruption of talks or
> other events, inappropriate physical contact, and unwelcome sexual
> attention. People asked to stop any harassing behaviour are expected to
> comply immediately.
> 
> If a person engages in harassing behaviour, DimSumLabs members may
> take any action they deem appropriate, including warning the offender
> or expulsion from the space or event. If you are being harassed,
> notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other
> concerns, please contact a member or director immediately.
> 
> This anti-harassment policy is based on the MakeHackVoid Code of
> Conduct, which in turn is based on the [example policy from the Geek
> Feminism wiki](http://geekfeminism.wikia.com/wiki/Conference_anti-harassment), created by the Ada Initiative and other volunteers.

## Internal Version for Members

This version is intended for internal use by DimSumLabs members. It
defines our enforcement policy.

### Warnings

Any member of DimSumLabs can issue a verbal warning to a person that
their behaviour violates the space's anti-harassment policy. Warnings
should be reported to dimsumlabs-members@lists.dimsumlabs.com as soon
as practical. The report should include:

* Identifying information (name) of the person
* The time you issued the warning
* The behaviour that was in violation
* The approximate time of the behaviour (if different than the time of warning)
* The circumstances surrounding the incident
* Your identity
* Other people involved in the incident

### Presentations

Presentations or similar events should not be stopped for one-time gaffes
or minor problems, although a member should speak to the presenter
afterward. However, members should take immediate action to politely
and calmly stop any presentation or event that repeatedly or seriously
violates the anti-harassment policy. For example, simply say "I'm sorry,
this presentation cannot be continued at the present time" with no
further explanation.

### Taking reports

When taking a report from someone experiencing harassment you should
record what they say and reassure them they are being taken seriously,
but avoid making specific promises about what actions DimSumLabs will
take. Ask for any other information if the reporter has not volunteered
it (such as time, place) but do not pressure them to provide it if they
are reluctant. Even if the report lacks important details such as the
identity of the person taking the harassing actions, it should still be
recorded and passed along to the directors. If the reporter desires it,
arrange for an escort by a trusted person, contact a friend, and contact
local law enforcement. Do not pressure the reporter to take any action if
they do not want to do it. Respect the reporter's privacy by not sharing
unnecessary details with others, especially individuals who were not
involved with the situation or non directors.

The report should include;

* Identifying information (name) of the person
* The time you issued the warning
* The behaviour that was in violation
* The approximate time of the behaviour (if different than the time of warning)
* The circumstances surrounding the incident
* Your identity
* Other people involved in the incident

### Expulsion

A person may be expelled by the decision of any of the above listed
entities for whatever reasons they deem sufficient. However, here are
some general guidelines for when a participant should be expelled:

* A third offence resulting in a warning
* Continuing to harass after any "No" or "Stop" instruction
* A pattern of harassing behaviour, with or without warnings
* A single serious offence (e.g., punching or groping someone)
* A single obviously intentional offence (e.g., taking up-skirt photos)

Local authorities should be contacted when appropriate.

### Public statements

As a general rule, DimSumLabs members should not make any public
statements about the behaviour of individual people in relation to the
code of conduct.

In general, consult with other members and directors when possible but
act when necessary.
